# Coffee Shop Management System (CS480 Project)

Full-stack coffee shop management application for a database systems course project.

This project implements a coffee shop system with two main roles:
- **Managers**: manage employees, inventory, and accounting reports
- **Baristas**: create orders, process payments, and sell drinks

The system is based on the CS480 project specification, which includes requirements around employees, menu, recipes, inventory, sales/orders, accounting, and optional analytics/LLM extensions.
